## Paintings and poems

{{< figure src="signes-nomades/adorateur-du-soleil.jpg">}}

To be read in symbols in the folds of time. <br>
Harmonized writing/painting <br>
in their forms, <br>
in their characters, <br>
in their strength. <br>
Between signs and symbols. <br>
On the edge of storms and catacombs. <br>
Nothing is more undecided. <br>
Nothing is more precarious. <br>
On the precariousness of signs <br>
and the indecision of symbols. <br>
<b>Abdelhak Serhane</b>

Signs <br>
which challenge us, <br>
question us <br>
and end <br>
by registering in us, <br>
like dreams <br>
that we carry within ourselves, <br>
or hopes. <br>
