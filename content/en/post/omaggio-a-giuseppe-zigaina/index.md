Dear Peppino,

you often told me on the phone "Angela don't abandon me", you meant to say: "I had to pay attention to you and what you wrote about Pasolini".

You accepted my interview request in 2001. I came to Cervignano in July, you welcomed me warmly in the small station, and we talked for a long time, for two days, in front of a camera (which I had just purchased) that filmed automatically.

I have a vivid memory of your house in Cervignano: your kindness and hospitality, your dear wife, Maria, so lovingly close to your art, to your person...

You told me about Pier Paolo, about your meeting, about your political struggles in Friuli, about your history, on the borders of Italy, on the north-eastern front, where little Italian was spoken, close to the Slavic world.

«The borders of the homeland are defended with the weapons of culture», you told me, referring to an idea of Pasolini's.

I invited you to the University of Montpellier in 2002, on the anniversary of the birth of the Friulian poet I had organized a conference, and it was very nice to listen to you, you also presented the exhibition of Pasolini's drawings at the library of our university.

I spoke about your story with Pier Paolo in my volume dedicated to the writer, I remained "open" to your hypotheses, underlining that your readings forced us to be very attentive to the text. You had a maniacal passion for the letter of the text, which you then interpreted in an allegorical sense, working on the symbols, on the cryptic allusions, on the meaning of the death of your great friend and poet.

"Angela, you abandoned me", you repeated to me, and then I told you, "no, you are ontological for me, as I am for you", paraphrasing one of your dialogues with Pasolini.

Then you once told me "You know, Pasolini predicted you too." I didn't understand. At the time, I thought of the character of Biancofiore, in the film "Mamma Roma".

I didn't pay attention to it until I experienced the loss in 2014 and watched over my "nini muart", my son who passed away at the age of 19.

The immense artistic work that brought you to the top of world art was fueled by your love for the territory, the land of Friuli, the fields, the trees, the waters, the lagoon and the sky.

The immense work of interpreting Pasolini's work arose from love for Pier Paolo, from respect for your friendship. You led critics to reflect on the sense of the sacred, that academic and cold criticism, at times dogmatic, which did not understand your desire for exegesis. You had the intellectual freedom of an artist and the passion that led you on the trail of Pasolini's initiatory itinerary.

Art and life: you have made your life a work of art, and with your fierce desire to clarify, to find a hidden meaning in Pasolini's violent life, you have found the roots of violence, that dark knot that lies within a large part of your pictorial production.

Your atelier was a sort of "battlefield", where the artist's melee became a vigorous sign and colour.

Thank you Peppino for guiding me on the paths of an initiatory journey, for talking to me about Pier Paolo, Casarsa and the frontiers of Europe, thank you for showing me – with Dante and Pasolini – that art is transhumanar, going beyond the borders of human, and that death is a gateway to access another sphere of being, to reconnect with ourselves and the world, as my son Mattia wrote: "ne faire plus qu'un avec le cosmos".
