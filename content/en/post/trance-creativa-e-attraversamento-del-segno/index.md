### The embodied trait

When I paint, in order for the signs to cross the body, I must make myself available and open to welcome them, I must reach a state of concentration such that the eye, the hand and the breath are in perfect harmony. We could call this non-ordinary state of consciousness "creative trance".

I try to describe this state with words and the rhythm of painting.

Painting bites life. Color penetrates color, fully, strongly, greedily, chaotically…

Color thirsty for color.

The line must be free, rapid, instantaneous: the stroke bites the color into the sheet.

The speed of the stroke must exceed the speed of thought. Color mixed with color on the surface of the sheet. The embodied trait. The stroke becomes flesh, blue red yellow in the arena of the sheet.

Like an arrow shot <br>
Like lightning in the sky <br>
Like volcanic eruption <br>
Like a river overflowing <br>
Like a wave that moves the entire sea <br>
The absolute sovereign trait reigns over the pristine field of the sheet <br>
I show the signs <br>
The signs emerge in me <br>
They overflow <br>
They pour onto the paper <br>
Signs of life, of sun, of birth, of eruption, of cry, of dialogue, of hunting, pursuit, violence
 

Signs of death-life <br>
birth destruction <br>
sky earth <br>
cold color warm color
 
The violence of the natural elements is expressed in the space of the sheet

Human violence runs through the paper

My signs-forces develop in space, demonstrate attraction and repulsion, forces that translate words, situations of communication or incommunicability: dialogue and non-dialogue, cry, word.

The signs convey cosmic forces, the strength of the elements: water, earth, air, fire.

My signs describe orbits, the result of opposing centrifugal and centripetal tensions, the signs-forces also embody situations of extreme anguish and terror: pursuit of prey, fury of predators, the breathing of the prey and the predator.

The moment of the struggle for survival is fundamental, necessary for life. And like everything that is vital, I am interested in it, since my signs do not tell anything inessential, but seek, in their sparse discourse, the foundation of the biological, the pre-human. The human is always rudimentary. What makes what is hidden visible is precisely the rudimentary character of art, since the artist wants to think everything that exists. But it is rudimentary to think about everything that exists. To be total, the image must be rudimentary. Artistic creation is in relation to the essential, to the naked condition of the human, it has nothing to do with aestheticizing production, the practice of art is a confrontation, a struggle, a bullfight according to the image of Leiris, the The work is the equivalent of the sharp horn of the bull which, with its threatening character, gives a human reality to art.

### Tabula Rasa

The prerequisite of artistic trance is the elimination of perceptive habits. Knowing how to see with new eyes, making visible the unseen, the invisible.

In front of the white sheet, the blank canvas, I do not find myself in front of the void, on the contrary. The white of the canvas or sheet is already totally colonized, as Deleuze states: "There is a mistake that the painter works on a white and bright surface. faudra breaks".

The trance state helps to temporarily cancel the automatisms of perception that prevent us from seeing with new eyes. The difficulty is to start from the white overcrowded with clichés and stereotyped images.

Isolation is then necessary. First of all, we must know how to defend ourselves from the flow of images and sounds that colonizes creative thought, and which largely comes from the media.

And so a lot of time and practice are necessary to rediscover creativity, the desire for symbolic activity that our society tends to eliminate in various ways.

In the atelier however, the painter's body is freed, it is confronted with the origin of the body and of the letter, with the body of writing. The painter's body operates on the horizontal canvas like Tàpies in his atelier: "The canvases created on the horizontal plane, the territory governed by the painter, expose everything that is included in that burden of the body on the paste and dust: connection with the ground, rooting, in-depth, solitary communication. Erected, like walls and mirrors, they instead propose an open, supportive, friendly communication" (Georges Raillard, Tapies in the atelier, in Antoni Tapies, Conversations with G. Raillard, edited by Giuseppe Zuccarino, Graphos, Genoa, 2002).

I paint on canvas or paper arranged horizontally on the ground, painting like plowing, the furrow is the sign.

Creative trance takes us back to original stages of consciousness, where the relationship between body and writing begins.

We read again about Tàpies: "Earth and painting (1956) or Serranda metallica and violin (1956) ... Works of this kind are not metaphors, but impose themselves on our sight, on our senses, thanks to what vibrates in them rhythm of a body - spirit and matter prior to logical separation, unity recovered in the vision of a new Form, always in movement, of a staggered series of rebirths [...]

there is the room [...] where the artistic activity takes place, with the gathering of energy, the immediate decision, the surprise and the recovery. But the work lies in continuity, in the unity of a movement of the entire being - affections, commitments, culture, reflection, intelligence, writing, sensitivity at the same time, the same time, that of the "single brush stroke", as say the Chinese" (Raillard, op. cit., underlining mine).

The artist feels the essential unity of the world more than anyone else. Thoughts and sensations converge in a single flow on paper and canvas.

To return to a primitive language, it is necessary to escape from binary logic: in reality, in primitive languages there is a sort of coincidence of opposites, the sacred and the abhorrent are expressed by the same word: "sacer" in Latin, "agios" in Greek.

When I paint and write my signs on the paper I think of one thing and its opposite, I cannot stop myself from proceeding through opposite poles (birth/destruction, life/death, dialogue/non-dialogue, light/darkness)

My signs are fundamentally Heraclitean, since from the opposites comes "callist harmony", the beautiful harmony...

The signs-forces signify opposing tensions: I painted a snake goddess, a character who tends towards the difficult balance between two opposite poles embodied by the snakes that she brandishes with open arms.

### Cosmos / chaos

Through the practice of "creative trance" I try to achieve the fundamental objective of my painting: making invisible forces visible.

In the paintings of the cycle The Metamorphoses of the Sun we can recognize embryos in formation, cells that reproduce, unions, separations, deaths, continuous rebirths.

The link between reproduction and the motion of the stars, sexual forces of creation and reproduction of life, sidereal forces of the universe, is evident in the signs. The tension that animates the cosmos-chaos. It is now known, all systems tend towards chaos and error, the cosmos - or order - is increasingly an intellectual fiction.

In order for the hand to trace and translate the pure rhythm of the body onto the surface, intensive practice is needed, a repetition of the same sign, which will never be identical to itself. Repetition guarantees the purging of the sign, the achievement of the essential character, the elimination of the superfluous.

What remains is the naked sign that is in relationship with the cosmic forces.

Chaos emerges from the mixing of colors. The governed randomness of the mixture of liquid substances, the inks, on the surface of the paper.

The dry sign tends to separate, the liquid sign tends to the fusion of the elements, continuous fusion and separation, as on the threshold of the organic.

Sign memory. I paint these signs because I am Greek. I belong to the world of the eastern Mediterranean, where sign and seal are the same thing. It is a world that produces signs and writings, where letters are traded on board ships. I am Cretan, Assyrian, Cypriot, Babylonian, Egyptian... I traveled the Mediterranean in search of common writing, I found the solar circle, the labyrinth, the minotaur, the ship... the signs of the human that can be summarized in fundamental themes: mating, hunting, war, death, life.

My signs start from the world of sun worshipers, hunters, predators to reach the world of agriculture and weaving.

My signs are intended to be the embodiment of myth, since "what is mythical is realistic and what is realistic is mythical" (Pasolini).

A few years ago I painted signs on earthy surfaces, often red ocher or golden ocher, the sign was hieratic, engraved as if on a rock, stable. Now the sign hovers in the air, it does not rest on the vertical ground of the pigments; it develops in space, it has acquired lightness, there is air in the ink line, as Chinese painters use to say. The signs swirl in the void as if to abolish the force of gravity.

Tracing signs for me means resisting the domination of a purely rational knowledge of the world.

My signs, synthesis of the human, defend an intuitive knowledge, within a reality subject to the empire of scientific and technological reason. Science also recognizes the importance of intuitive knowledge.

Ernesto Sabato, despite having a scientific background, fiercely opposes the empire of reason by defending mythopoetic thought against a culture characterized by a positivistic and dehumanized arrogance: "Le surréalisme apparut comme un feu purificateur contre une culture déshumanisée. On ne I'm sure you'll be surprised that these fragments are of great importance to the mythopoetic thought and to the man who brought the positivist arrogance of Europeans to the category of "primitive". 'esprit tout va vers son contraire; et l'excès de scientisme nous conduit à son rejet" (Les écrivains et la catastrophe).

Science will not be able to give answers to the question of human existence, in Sabato's reflection objective knowledge then gives way to tragic knowledge. Faced with the vast apparatus of universal domination, creative activity takes on a high value of knowledge. Creative trance allows you to reach phases of consciousness that cannot be reached otherwise. Through creative trance one can return to the archeology of the subject, travel backwards to the threshold of the biological, recover memories buried by centuries of collective life increasingly less close to the natural world.

We live in an environment made up largely of artificial substances. Touching stone, water, wood, iron are experiences that are not part of everyday life and yet they are gestures so necessary to life.

Creative trance seeks to rediscover that fundamental relationship with the lifeblood and at the same time is an act of resistance to an artificial universe dominated by the instinct of death and domination.

Deleuze states: "art, c'est ce qui résiste: il résiste à la mort, à la servitude, à l'infamie, à la honte". Painting is a possible form of resistance to a homogenizing society where symbolic activity is cancelled, where the only principle is the market and the logic of productivity.

For me, painting has this essential function: to be a flow that combines with other flows: intense, instantaneous and changeable, suspended, like cosmic forces, between creation and destruction.
