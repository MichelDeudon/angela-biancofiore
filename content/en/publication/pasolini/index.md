abstract: The emerging work of Pier Paolo Pasolini occupies a prominent place in the contemporary cultural panorama - it is a current reflection, at times prophetic, because it announces the question of the creation and destruction of cultural worlds . A necessary work for our critical thinking - in the dialogue of voices which seek another way out, which construct an alternative vision to the transformation of the world and of humans into commodities. <br><br> This essay constitutes an itinerary through his multiform creation, from Friulian origins to the last period marked by allegorical writing - an effort of analysis and understanding which intends to highlight all artistic languages adopted by the author - from poetry to cinema, from novel to painting, from theater to anthropological essay, while knowing that to work for Pasolini means to design a cultural project. <br><br> It is essential today to free his work from a purely aesthetic reading in order to aim at its deep meaning in a broader cultural perspective - such is the position of our author and, in a sense, his profound legacy. <br><br> The second part of this book is devoted to the critical readings sparked by Pasolin's work - the panorama of authors, immense and very diverse, highlights the interpretations which touch on all aspects of his work and which demonstrate the possibilities of analysis, openness and dialogue. <br><br> The articulation of the main critical trends only confirms the enormous richness of Pasolinian creation which remains linked to the character - because, unlike many intellectuals, he knew how to be physically present on the stage of history, always on the line of fire, where “the world is renewed”.
