abstract: Matiah, a young poet, composer and pianist, has recorded a singular journey in his latest notebooks - with rare intensity, his verses condense the fruit of his experience, both personal and universal. Speech reveals a discovery of each moment of the surrounding world, a constant progression towards a deep consciousness - a gaze which is constructed and which penetrates the universe, from the microcosm to the macrocosm, from the subtle vibration of an atom to the star. The pure colors of Angela Biancofiore's paintings, inspired by a musical composition by Matiah – I see two suns – accompany a poetic word woven with silence and light which leads us towards freedom and fullness of spirit.

## Excerpts from the Book of Matiah Eckhard

The water that springs from the rock <br>
so pure, powerful and sweet. <br>
Drink it with both hands <br>
facing the radiant colors of pure air: <br>
from outside <br>
constantly gushing out <br>
feel its power and purity <br>
giving yourself something to drink from the universe <br>
imagine ourselves in the gift of self outside of ourselves. <br>
So I am this water which constantly springs from the rock <br>
under the harmonious light.

TONIGHT I CAN SIT <br>
OF MY WORDS FLOWING FLOW <br>
OF THIS SKY-COLOURED HONEY <br>
OF THIS WORLD TRANSLATED INTO WAVES <br>
TONIGHT I CAN TRANSLATE <br>
THE WAVES OF FLOWING HONEY <br>
THE HEAVEN OF MY WORDS ON THE WAVES <br>
WORDS FROM HEAVEN IN HONEY <br>
   – Sky color –

### Fall preliminaries

Milky sky <br>
leaning trees <br>
leaves descend, <br>
carry the ground in search of mortality. <br>
Birds are hiding, <br>
meet again <br>
to better appreciate each other. <br>
Autumn, time of delicacy, <br>
the world heads down, <br>
regains his wisdom. <br>
The river dreams of the sea, <br>
the sea of the Ocean, <br>
time longs for the past, <br>
the meadows their faded flowers. <br>
Poignant love, tears of happiness, <br>
each loves the other in his home.
 
### Why do I like jazz?
 
I like jazz because when I play it I am happy, <br>
because when I listen to it, I am no less happy. <br>
I love jazz because it inspires me with the purest form of happiness, <br>
this pure form can be a kind of Nirvana, <br>
something very physical. <br>
So I have happiness in my guts, my body is happy <br>
so i'm happy
 
### Winter song
 
Fresh light <br>
make the colors ripple <br>
on the treetops. <br>
A ray pierces the clear clouds, <br>
this ray fulminates, intoxicates, <br>
like lightning, <br>
he surprises. <br>
My heart hangs on this ray. <br>
It oxygenates, it gives <br>
momentum to my vision. <br>
The ray fulminates but the light is soft, <br>
so sweet, a flow of life emanates from this ray, <br>
it becomes the artery of my mind, <br>
it recharges me, amplifies me, fulfills me. <br>
I feel full, <br>
full of these reflections that tickle me <br>
the face like a breeze. <br>
O Sweet breakthrough of the clouds, <br>
winter song, make it ripple <br>
what I had, through weariness, petrified.
