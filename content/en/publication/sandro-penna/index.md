abstract: Sandro Penna - between confused dreams and apparitions, under the direction of Christelle Balderas-Laignelet and Angela Biancofiore.<br> <b>Texts</b> by Christelle Balderas, Angela Biancofiore, Yannick Gouchan, Myriam Carminati, Anonio Prete. <br> <b>Translation</b> of the collection Confused Dream (Garzanti, 1980) by Christelle Balderas-Laignelet. <br> <b>Paintings</b> by Angela Biancofiore. <br><br> A tribute to the poetry of Sandro Penna, this is the form of a collective book on the poetry of the 'poet of lightness', poet of love and song, going against the official word , a modest word that resonates, a word of encounter that celebrates the beauty of the world. The work is immense in its apparent simplicity, the poem is constructed in an incantatory musicality, the poetic word comes closer to the meaning and suspends it. Knowing and making Penna's poetry known is the aim of this work which brings together the work of several researchers, the different readings intersect around the essential axes of the author's poetic universe. Entering the poetic universe of Penna means not only rediscovering an entire Italian literary tradition, from Dante and Petrarch to Pascoli, Saba and Pasolini, but also hearing and feeling these deep affinities with Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Gide; in a secret or sometimes obvious way, the endecasyllable structures the song from within, the transgression of the rules of prosody is grafted onto the ground of a vast poetic tradition. However, verse never presents itself as a pure form or artifice, its apparent simplicity reconnects with the reality of the world, poetry is as close as possible to life. <br><br> <b>Price â‚¬22</b> <br> Order by e-mail <a href="mailto:info.cladole@free.fr">info.cladole@free.fr</a> <br> 7, rue de l'Aqueduc 34160 Castries tel. 09 51 97 57 90.
