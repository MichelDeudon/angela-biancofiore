## Excerpt from poems

Underground flow <br>
which irrigates the roots <br>
distills blue stains <br>
welcomes <br>
the white Nothingness

Terrestrial rhapsodies <br>
depth curves <br>
climbing on the Vif <br>
rise and sink <br> <br>

On the curly ribbon <br>
an open cove port and relay <br>
fugues from the Sacred <br> <br>

Emerging <br>
parts of the world <br>
Archipelago <br>
of welded breaks <br> <br>
 
At the heart of the waves emerges <br>
Interval <br>
open <br>
by Listening to the Abyss
